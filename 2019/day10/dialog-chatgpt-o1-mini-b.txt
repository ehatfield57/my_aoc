Certainly! Let's enhance the previous Elixir solution to **read the asteroid map from a file named `day10-data.txt`** instead of using a hardcoded string. This approach makes the solution more flexible and suitable for larger or different inputs.

### **Updated Solution Overview**

1. **Read Input from File:** Modify the code to read the asteroid map from `day10-data.txt`.
2. **Handle File Reading Errors:** Ensure the program gracefully handles scenarios where the file might not exist or cannot be read.
3. **Maintain Existing Functionality:** Keep the parsing, visibility calculation, and best location determination as previously implemented.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### 1. **Prepare the Input File**

- **Create `day10-data.txt`:** Ensure that you have a file named `day10-data.txt` in the same directory as your Elixir script. This file should contain the asteroid map, where each line represents a row in the grid, and each character is either an asteroid (`#`) or empty space (`.`).

  **Example `day10-data.txt`:**
  ```
  .#..#
  .....
  #####
  ....#
  ...##
  ```

  Replace the above content with your actual input data.

#### 2. **Updated Elixir Code**

Below is the updated Elixir code that reads the asteroid map from `day10-data.txt` and processes it to find the best location for the monitoring station.

```elixir
defmodule MonitoringStation do
  @moduledoc """
  Solution for Advent of Code 2019, Day 10, Part 1.

        content

        IO.puts("Error reading file #{file_path}: #{reason}")
        System.halt(1)
    end
  end

      |> Enum.filter(fn {char, _x} -> char == "#" end)
      |> Enum.map(fn {_char, x} -> {x, y} end)
    end)
  end

  @doc """

      other_asteroids = List.delete(asteroids, asteroid)

      angles =
        other_asteroids
        |> Enum.map(fn other ->
          dx = elem(other, 0) - elem(asteroid, 0)
          dy = elem(other, 1) - elem(asteroid, 1)
          :math.atan2(dy, dx)
        end)
        |> Enum.uniq()

      Map.put(acc, asteroid, length(angles))
    end)
  end

  @doc """

  Returns a tuple with the best asteroid's coordinates and the count.
  """
  def find_best_location(map) do
    asteroids = parse_map(map)
    visibility = calculate_visibility(asteroids)

    {best_asteroid, max_count} =
      visibility
      |> Enum.max_by(fn {_asteroid, count} -> count end)

    {best_asteroid, max_count}
  end

  @doc """
  The main entry point of the script.
  Reads the asteroid map from 'day10-data.txt', finds the best location, and prints the result.
  """
  def main do
    file_path = "day10-data.txt"
    map = read_map_from_file(file_path)
    {best_location, count} = find_best_location(map)
    IO.puts("Best Location: #{inspect(best_location)} with #{count} detectable asteroids.")
  end
end

# Execute the main function when the script is run
MonitoringStation.main()
```

#### 3. **Explanation of the Changes**

1. **`read_map_from_file/1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Reads the content of `day10-data.txt`.
   - **Error Handling:** If the file cannot be read (e.g., it doesn't exist), the program prints an error message and exits gracefully.
   - **Usage:** This function is called in the `main/0` function to obtain the asteroid map.

2. **`main/0`:**
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point of the script.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Reads the asteroid map from `day10-data.txt`.
     - Processes the map to find the best location.
     - Prints the result to the console.
   - **Execution:** The `main/0` function is invoked at the end of the script to run the program when executed.

3. **Removed the Hardcoded Map:**
   - The previous example usage with a hardcoded `map` string has been removed.
   - The script now relies entirely on the contents of `day10-data.txt`.

4. **`String.split/2` Enhancement:**
   - Added the `trim: true` option to `String.split/2` to remove any trailing empty lines, ensuring robust parsing.

#### 4. **Running the Updated Code**

1. **Ensure File Placement:**
   - Place the `day10-data.txt` file in the **same directory** as your Elixir script (e.g., `monitoring_station.exs`).

2. **Save the Script:**
   - Save the updated Elixir code to a file, for example, `monitoring_station.exs`.

3. **Execute the Script:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `monitoring_station.exs` and `day10-data.txt`.
   - Run the script using Elixir:

     ```bash
     elixir monitoring_station.exs
     ```

4. **Expected Output:**
   - The program will output the best location and the number of detectable asteroids. For example:

     ```
     Best Location: {3, 4} with 8 detectable asteroids.
     ```

   - This indicates that the asteroid at coordinates `{3, 4}` can detect `8` other asteroids, which is the maximum for the provided map.

#### 5. **Sample `day10-data.txt` and Output**

**Sample `day10-data.txt`:**
```
.#..#
.....
#####
....#
...##
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Best Location: {3, 4} with 8 detectable asteroids.
```

#### 6. **Additional Enhancements (Optional)**

For improved usability and flexibility, you might consider the following enhancements:

- **Command-Line Arguments:**
  - Allow the user to specify the input file path as a command-line argument.
  
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Implement tests to verify the correctness of each function, especially `parse_map/1` and `calculate_visibility/1`.

- **Optimizations:**
  - For very large maps, consider optimizing the visibility calculation, possibly by caching or using more efficient data structures.

However, for the scope of **Advent of Code 2019, Day 10, Part 1**, the provided solution should suffice.

### **Conclusion**

By modifying the Elixir script to read from an external file, we've made the solution more adaptable and user-friendly. You can now easily change the input by updating `day10-data.txt` without altering the code. This approach is particularly beneficial for handling large inputs or running multiple test cases.
