You're welcome! I'm glad the Part One solution worked well for you. Now, let's tackle **Advent of Code 2019, Day 8, Part Two** using Elixir. We'll build upon the previous script to decode and display the final image.

## Part Two Overview

In **Part Two**, the goal is to decode the image by determining the color of each pixel based on the layers:

1. **Image Composition**:
   - The image is composed of multiple layers.
   - Each layer has the same dimensions (width × height).
   - To decode the image, for each pixel position, you determine its final color by finding the first non-transparent pixel in that position when stacking the layers from top to bottom.

2. **Pixel Values**:
   - `0`: Black
   - `1`: White
   - `2`: Transparent

3. **Final Output**:
   - The decoded image should be rendered in a human-readable format, typically using characters to represent black and white pixels.

## Updated Elixir Script: `day08.exs`

We'll modify the existing `day08.exs` script to include functionality for Part Two. The script will now:

1. **Read the input from `day08-data.txt`.**
2. **Parse the layers based on the image dimensions.**
3. **Decode the image by determining the color of each pixel.**
4. **Render the final image to the console.**

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Module Documentation**:
   - Updated the `@moduledoc` to indicate that the module now handles both Parts One and Two.

2. **Function `solve_part_one/3`**:
   - Encapsulates the solution for Part One.
   - Returns the product of the number of '1's and '2's in the layer with the fewest '0's.

3. **Function `solve_part_two/3`**:
   - Handles the solution for Part Two.
   - Decodes the image and renders it to the console.

4. **Function `decode_image/3`**:
   - Iterates through each pixel position.
   - For each position, it finds the first non-transparent pixel (`0` or `1`) across all layers.
   - Constructs the final image as a list of pixel values.

5. **Function `render_image/3`**:
   - Converts the final image list into a two-dimensional structure based on the image's width and height.
   - Maps each pixel value to a display character:
     - `'0'` (black) is represented by a space `" "`.
     - `'1'` (white) is represented by a solid block `"█"`.
     - `'2'` (transparent) is treated as black/space.
   - Prints each row to the console, effectively rendering the image.

6. **Script Execution Block**:
   - After solving Part One and printing its result, it proceeds to solve Part Two and render the decoded image.

### How to Use the Updated Script

1. **Ensure You Have the Input File**:
   - The script expects a file named `day08-data.txt` in the same directory.
   - Ensure that this file contains your puzzle input (a continuous string of digits).

2. **Adjust Image Dimensions If Necessary**:
   - By default, the script uses `width = 25` and `height = 6`, which are typical for Advent of Code Day 8.
   - If your specific puzzle uses different dimensions, modify the `width` and `height` variables in the script accordingly.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing `day08.exs` and `day08-data.txt`.
   - Execute the script using Elixir:
     ```bash
     elixir day08.exs
     ```

4. **Interpreting the Output**:
   - **Part One**: The script will first print the result for Part One.
   - **Part Two**: It will then print the decoded image to the console.

   **Example Output**:
   ```
   Part One Result: 1

   Part Two Result:
   █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
   █     █   █   █ █     █ █ █     █ █ █ █   █     █
   █ █ █ █   █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
   █     █   █   █     █     █   █     █ █     █     █
   █ █ █ █   █ █ █   █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
   █     █   █   █   █     █   █     █   █     █     █
   ```

   *(Note: The actual output will depend on your specific input data.)*

### Testing with the Provided Example

Let's verify that the script works correctly using the example you provided earlier.

1. **Set Up Example Input**:
   - In `day08-data.txt`, insert the following input:
     ```plaintext
     0222112222120000
     ```
   
2. **Adjust Image Dimensions for the Example**:
   - For the example, the image dimensions are `width = 2` and `height = 2`.
   - Modify the `width` and `height` variables in the script accordingly:
     ```elixir
     width = 2
     height = 2
     ```
   
3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     elixir day08.exs
     ```
   
4. **Expected Output**:
   - **Part One**: Since this is an example for Part Two, Part One might not be meaningful, but the script will still execute it.
   - **Part Two**: The expected decoded image is:
     ```
     █ 
     █ 
     ```
   
   *(Note: Based on the example input, the final image should display two white pixels stacked vertically.)*

5. **Revert to Puzzle Dimensions**:
   - After testing, remember to set the `width` and `height` back to the puzzle's dimensions (e.g., `width = 25`, `height = 6`) before running it with your actual puzzle input.

### Additional Enhancements

1. **Customizable Pixel Representation**:
   - You can modify the `pixel_to_char/1` function to use different characters or colors for better visualization.
   - For example, using `"⬜"` for white and `"⬛"` for black:
     ```elixir
     defp pixel_to_char("0"), do: "⬛"
     defp pixel_to_char("1"), do: "⬜"
     defp pixel_to_char(_), do: "⬛"
     ```

2. **Saving the Image to a File**:
   - If you prefer to save the decoded image to a text file instead of printing it to the console, you can modify the `render_image/3` function accordingly.

3. **Error Handling for Image Decoding**:
   - Ensure that the input data length is a multiple of `width * height`.
   - Add validations to handle cases where the input data might be malformed.

### Complete Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a complete example using the test input.

1. **Example Input (`day08-data.txt`)**:
   ```plaintext
   0222112222120000
   ```

2. **Script Modification for Example**:
   - Set `width = 2` and `height = 2`.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   elixir day08.exs
   ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   Part One Result: 4

   Part Two Result:
   █ █
   █ █
   ```

   - **Part One**:
     - Layers:
       1. `0222`
       2. `1122`
       3. `2212`
       4. `0000`
     - Layer counts of '0's:
       1. 1
       2. 0
       3. 1
       4. 4
     - The layer with the fewest '0's is the second layer (`1122`) with 0 '0's.
     - Number of '1's: 2
     - Number of '2's: 2
     - Product: `2 * 2 = 4`

   - **Part Two**:
     - Decoded image:
       ```
       █ █
       █ █
       ```
     - This corresponds to the following pixel arrangement:
       ```
       1 1
       1 1
       ```

## Conclusion

The updated Elixir script `day08.exs` now handles both Parts One and Two of **Advent of Code 2019, Day 8**. It efficiently reads the input, processes the layers, and decodes the final image, rendering it in a human-readable format.

### Recap of Steps

   - Ensure you have Elixir installed.
   - Create `day08.exs` and `day08-data.txt` with the appropriate content.
